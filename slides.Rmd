## Scientific Programming

### What is Scientific Programming?

**Definition**

::: {style="display: flex;"}
<div>

> Scientific programming is the use of computer programming to solve scientific problems, analyse data, and build simulations.

</div>

<div>

</div>
:::

## Scientific Programming

### ... and when I say Science, I mean...

Any field where there is systematic and evidence-based approaches used to understand the natural world, the processes that govern it, and the people and creatures that live within it.

**Including...**

::: {style="display: flex;"}
<div>

-   Physical sciences
-   Life sciences
-   Computer sciences
-   Natural sciences

</div>

<div>

-   Social sciences
-   Human sciences
-   Applied sciences
-   Formal sciences

</div>

## Who can it help?

Programming can assist with any research that deals with data and information.

![](figures/data_meme.jpg){style="text-align: center" width="577"}

## But why would I need it...

#### 1. Many new analyses can only be implemented with code.

::: {style="display: flex;"}
-   *More researchers are using programming.*
-   *Data sources are a LOT bigger and more complicated now..*
-   *Standard data analysis software are not up to the task*

![](figures/exccel_primitive.jpg){width="292" height="225"}
:::

## But why would I need it...

#### 2. Your analysis needs to be repeated on multiple data sets, or data sets that are regularly updated.

::: {style="display: flex;"}
<div>

-   *Data cleaning can be extremely time-consuming and onerous and not feasible to be repeated multiple times.*

-   *Repeating analyses perfectly consistently can be tricky with standard software.*

-   *Real-time analysis may be needed for dynamic data sets.*

</div>

![](figures/cleaning.PNG){width="500" height="250"}
:::

## But why would I need it...

#### 3. You want to develop your data analytic skills

::: {style="display: flex;"}
-   *Programming skills are highly desired*

-   *Boosts productivity*

-   *See it as a long-term investment into your own career development.*

## Why not?

### It is not easy to learn a programming language.

![](figures/datasciencelearn.webp){width="359"}

## Why not?

### Programming is not always a time-saver.

# What does programming in research look like?

## Example: NSW BMI Study

The data sets in question, `NSW_income.csv`, `house_coord.csv` and `bmi_study.rds` contain synthetic observations based on 2016 table builder personal income estimates of NSW adults (15+) with a recorded non-negative personal income and a generated linear mixed effects modelled data. `NSW_income.rds` and `bmi_study.rds` contains individual level information, whereas `house_coord.rds` contains household address information.

**This is not REAL data but simulated for the purposes of teaching.**

## Example: NSW BMI Study

::: {style="font-size:16pt;"}
The `bmi_study` data set pertains to a synthetic longitudinal study of individuals from the `NSW_income` data set which assesses the effectiveness of three treatment options in reducing the BMI of overweight individuals over 5 months. The study recorded the changes in BMI from initial values at the end of each month after receiving one of three treatment options:

1.  No Treatment (Control)
2.  Diet Therapy
3.  Diet Therapy and Exercise Regime

We aim to conduct an analysis considering how treatment effected the change in BMI seen over the 5 months whilst accounting for demographic factors including age, sex, socioeconomic status and geographical remoteness.

# Which statistical programming package is best?

## Choosing a Statistical Package

**Why do you need a statistical package?**

-   Data manipulation

-   Descriptive statistics

-   Visualisation

-   Modeling/inference

-   Teaching

**What is your research question?**

**What does your data look like?**

## What is your research question?

-   Are you describing a sample/population?

-   Are you looking at differences or relationships between groups?

-   Is visualisation (pretty figures and graphs) important?

-   Are you analysing survey data?

-   Are you investigating a change over time?

-   Is there missing data?

-   Is there clustered/multilevel data?

-   Will your model be complicated?

## What does your data look like?

-   How big is your dataset?

    -   Can you do it on your laptop? Do you need special computing facilities, high performance computing.

-   Do you have to link datasets?

-   Is your data complicated (linked, relational, administrative)

-   Are you going to be working on this project for a long time?

-   Are you working with collaborators in other schools, disciplines, UOW (different packages)?

## What are your options?

### There are LOTS of stats programs...

:::

## R and RStudio

### Cons

<div>

-   Steep learning curve

:::

## Python

### Cons

-   Not as many stats packages as R (though many general programming packages).
-   No braces, no semi-colons, indentation is used to structure code.
-   Still a steep learning curve.
-   Reading someone else's code can be tough for beginners.
-   Visualisations possible but not as good as others ( R ).
-   High memory usage.

## IBM SPSS Statistics

### Pros

-   Choice of old school statisticians.

## STATA

### Cons

-   Learning the code unique to STATA.
-   Menu driven options not as user friendly as other packages.
-   Only used in some discipline areas.
-   Not very intergratable with other programming pipelines.
-   Less and less people are using it now.
-   Limited analyses, simulations, and coding.
-   No access at UOW!

## What about EXCEL?

### DO NOT USE EXCEL FOR DATA ANALYSIS

::: {style="display:flex;font-size:13pt;"}

-   No capacity to store code of changes made

-   Analysis is not reproducible

-   Formulas are hidden in cells and can be accidentally overwritten

-   Easy to accidentally change numbers and no way to trace this

-   Limited data size

-   Encourages chartjunk

-   "Friends don't let Friends use excel for statistics"  (Cryer, <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.617.4297&rep=rep1&type=pdf> )
